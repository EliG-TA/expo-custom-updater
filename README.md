<h2 align="center">Expo Custom Updater</h2>

## Intro

Hi! this is a small project done to help myself on new Expo projects to better handle OTA updates done via Expo Publish.  

Expo OTA updates is a great system that automatically checks for new version on application startup if you set updates.checkAutomatically in app.json (i.e. to 30000 for 30 seconds).
  
The problem is that the users will only see your code (and your fixes) on the NEXT application startup.  
This makes it hard to predict when the new code will be actually available in the app, expecially with some users that never close their applications.  
  
Writing a manual update routine can be difficult as a bug in this process may cause your app to be stuck in an update cycle (speaking from experience ðŸ¤£) 

This library have two goals:
* Force an update on every app startup
* Force an update when the user go back to the application after some time

In this way your users will always run the up-to-date code published on Expo, either when opening the app for the fist time or when coming back to it!

Following some issues with last expo updates the package expo-updates is no longer a dependency but a peer-dependency.
Please add the package to your main project

## Install

* `npm install expo-custom-updater expo-updates` or
* `yarn add expo-custom-updater expo-updates`

## Configue app.json

Add below config in Expo project's `app.json` to prevent Expo from automatically fetching the latest update every time your app is launched.

```
"updates": {
    "enabled": true,
    "checkAutomatically": "ON_ERROR_RECOVERY"
}
```
    
## Just force an update on every app startup

```JavaScript
import ExpoCustomUpdater from 'expo-custom-updater'

const customUpdater = new ExpoCustomUpdater()

customUpdater.doUpdateIfAvailable()

```

doUpdateIfAvailable is an asyncronus Promise so you can await for it or better place it in the Expo loadResourcesAsync

```JavaScript
async function loadResourcesAsync() {
  await Promise.all([
    customUpdater.doUpdateIfAvailable(),
    Asset.loadAsync([
      require('....'),
      require('...'),
    ]),
    ....
```

doUpdateIfAvailable now accepts a "force" parameter to skip the result of Expo's Updates.checkForUpdateAsync() and always performs a download / install. Use only during development, it's not ideal to have it in production.

```JavaScript
customUpdater.doUpdateIfAvailable(true),
```

## Full setup with App State Change listener 

This allows to check for updates when user returns into the app after some time.
You can set the following options in the class constructor:

* minRefreshSeconds (optional, default 300) Do not check for updates before minRefreshSeconds from the last check .  
A check for new version will not be done if user switch back to the app within 5 minutes  
* showDebugInConsole (optional, default false) Show what the library is doing in the console 
* beforeCheckCallback (optional) Callback function before the check, useful to show a loading / spinner screen
* beforeDownloadCallback (optional) Callback function before fetching a new update, useful to show a loading screen with a message about a new version
* afterCheckCallback (optional) Callback function after the check, useful to hide a loading screen if no updates are available (if an update is found the application is restarted).
* throwUpdateErrors (optional, default false) will trhow an exception in case of update errors. It's important to handle this exception properly as setting this to true and not catching the error could result in an infinite update / crash /restart loop

You can then enable the listener for AppState changes that will trigger an update check when user comes back to the App by running
customUpdater.registerAppStateChangeListener()

Before and when the check is completed the two callbacks will be run, useful to show a loading screen 


```JavaScript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  constructor (props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { showLoadingScreen: true }
    this.customUpdater = new ExpoCustomUpdater({
      minRefreshSeconds: 600,
      showDebugInConsole: true, // Only for debugging update issues
      beforeCheckCallback: () => this.setState({ showLoadingScreen: true }),
      beforeDownloadCallback: () => this.setState({updateMessage: 'A new version of the app is being downloaded'}),
      afterCheckCallback: () => this.setState({ showLoadingScreen: false }),
      awaitForUpdate: false // Set to true to wait for the update process, useful for simple apps keeping the splash screen up until update is completed
    })
  }
  componentDidMount () { // example with update during startup
    this.customUpdater.registerAppStateChangeListener()
    await Promise.all([
      (async () => { try { await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() } catch (e) {} })(),
      this.customUpdater.registerAppStateChangeListener(),
      this.customUpdater.doUpdateIfAvailable(),
    ])
    this.setState({ isLoadingComplete: true })
    SplashScreen.hideAsync().catch()
  }

  componentWillUnmount () {
    this.customUpdater.removeAppStateChangeListener()
  }

```

 ## Notes:
* You can read activity logs from customUpdater.updateLog (array of strings), useful for debugging
* Expo does not support OTA updates from development or within the Expo App, so check for updates is skipped in __DEV__ mode.
* To test your application update method properly it is useful to compile an APK and install it to a connected device with "adb install xxx.apk", then you can play with expo publish to verify the setup 

Have fun!
